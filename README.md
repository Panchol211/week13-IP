# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning in R

**Project 1 Description**


For this analysis, the goal is to prepare advertisement related data and use insights from EDA to identify individuals who are most likely to click on a cryptography course advertisement. Later on, the analysis will create a supervised learning model to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in the blog. The data used for the analysis was collected from a prior advertisement for a similar course on the same platform. The dataset contains 10 attributes and 1,000 records. These attributes contain descriptive information of past blog users. Some of the attributes include country, age and gender of the user among others.

**Project 2 Description**


In this analysis, the goal is to use past retail data to understand customers' behavior and learn the characteristics of various customer groups for a retail company in Russia. Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

This analysis aims to use unsupervised learning techniques in R to respond to the research question. More specifically, we will perform clustering to develop insights from analysis and visualizations. Upon implementation, we shall also provide comparisons between two approaches i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of the analysis. The findings should help inform the team in formulating the marketing and sales strategies of the brand.
